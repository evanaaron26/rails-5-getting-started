# Rails Guides

Here are some guides to help you create a Rails app.

You can look at [examples](examples.md) of files in a Rails app.

Or you can get a [super short guide](short_guide.md) to quickly get a simple Rails app up and running.

Finally, you can create an app that uses [Rails with Bootstrap](rails_bootstrap.md).
